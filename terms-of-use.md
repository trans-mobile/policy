Contribution to the Application, you grant to Walmart a perpetual, non-exclusive (meaning you are free
to license your Contribution to anyone else in addition to Walmart), fully-paid, and royalty-free
(meaning that Walmart is not required to pay you to use your Contribution), sublicensable, and

derivative works of, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, rent, resell, and distribute the
Contribution.

All of the content on the Application (&quot;Materials&quot;), the trademarks, service marks, and logos contained on

### 8. Other Websites

The Application may contain links to other websites. This Agreement does not apply to Other Websites.
You should review the privacy policies and terms and conditions of each Other Website for more
information about how it may use any Communications you make to that site and how each Other
Website may share information about you with others, including Walmart.

Given the dynamic nature of websites, it is not reasonable for anyone to review all of the material on a
website. Accordingly, Walmart will not review all of the material made available through Other
Websites. The availability of these links does not mean that Walmart endorses any Other Websites or
any materials, opinions, goods, or services available on Other Websites. Third-party materials accessed
through or used by means of the Other Websites may also be protected by copyright and other
intellectual property laws.

### 9. Term

This Agreement shall continue in effect while you are authorized to use the Application. However,
Walmart reserves the right to deny access to, and use of, the Application for any lawful reason, including
for violations of this Agreement or for conduct inconsistent with Walmart&#39;s policies or codes of conduct.
Even after your access rights and use have terminated, the following sections will remain in effect: 3
(Grant of License to Walmart), 4 (Passwords), 5 (Intellectual Property Rights), 8 (Other Websites), 9
(Term), 12 (Disputes Between Associates), 13 (Arbitration of Disputes with Walmart), 14 (Warranty
Disclaimers), 15 (Limitation on Liability), 16 (Indemnity), and 17 (Miscellaneous).

### 10. Copyright Policy

Walmart may terminate the access rights of repeat copyright infringers. If you are a copyright owner

Wal-Mart Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&quot;DMCA&quot;) Notice.

### 11. Modifications

We may modify this Agreement from time to time. When we do, we will notify you by email. It is,
therefore, very important that you notify us when your email address changes. You may do so by
clicking “view your profile” then “edit” on WalmartOne. Any changes to this Agreement will also be
reflected on the Application. If you continue to use the Application after a modified Agreement has
been emailed to you or posted, you agree to be bound by the new Agreement. If you do not wish to
be bound by the new Agreement, do not use the Application.
